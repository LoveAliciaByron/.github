                            - I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also readable, maintainable, and scalable. My development process includes:
                            - - **Planning**: Breaking down problems into manageable tasks and designing robust solutions.
                              - - **Testing**: Writing unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.
                                - - **Documentation**: Keeping code and processes well-documented for future reference.
                                  - - **Collaboration**: Working closely with teams to share ideas and solve challenges together.
